I had a narcissistic boss who was emotionally abusive.

I could smell food being made inside homes, and I could hear kids playing in the backyard. I realized how badly I crave family life, and miss my family who lives all the way in Brazil. <br /><br />I felt lonely because there is always a dissonance to what I am experiencing. I never lived in big Canadian houses growing up. They look like the movies. <br /><br />I never walked my golden retriever in a park. I never ran unsupervised with my friends, freely, around the neighbourhood. <br /><br />Instead of bemoaning how badly I miss Brazil - the music, the warmth, the colours and trees, and most importantly, my language - I am here now. I am trying to let go of my old life (kicking and screaming) and build a Canadian life. It feels like the loneliest thing in the world to do. I don’t know anybody else who is doing it.

I am so grateful that I have somewhere to go, but at the same time, I get exhausted having to adopt other people’s lives, customs, etc. My mind is always somewhere else around the holidays. I have definitely cried in bathrooms after Christmas dinner. <br /><br />I feel lonely when I hear people talking about immigrants in a particular way, because I am an immigrant, even though I don’t look like what people perceive an immigrant to be. I feel lonely that my partner doesn’t like my country’s cuisine. I feel lonely when I want to greet people with a warm hug and kisses on their cheeks, but Canadians don’t really like being touched.

It can be very isolating and, well, lonely to feel that everyone around you is moving forward while you remain cemented to where you are.

I would go to work and basically come right back home to an empty house. I explored the city a lot on my own but it only did so much. I wanted to see my friend so badly, but she didn‘t have time for me.

I suffer from depression normally and being isolated in a new city was making it worse. I haven't seen or really talked to her since. <br /><br />To make matters worse, right before the holidays another one of my best friends from elementary school back home told me she couldn't be friends with someone who didn't support our president (Trump!) and blocked my phone number and me on all outlets of social media. She was one of the only friends I had left that still lived in my hometown.

Well, finding that is easier said than done, but I felt that I had found that with my coworkers. We‘re all around the same age and enjoy spending time with one another. However, as time goes on, I‘ve found that we‘re drifting apart and don‘t really connect the same way we used to. We used to all go to lunch together, and would round everyone up so we could all eat together in the break room. Recently though, I looked up from my computer and realized that I was all alone in the office. It was 11:30, and everyone had gone to lunch without me, and never told me that they were leaving. I felt so abandoned and isolated, that it triggered my loneliness again and I‘ve been struggling to cope since. I've found that being left out of group conversations, jokes, etc. is a big trigger for me, and so even though this incident was small, it felt so deliberate, that I've been wondering why my \"squad\" has decided that I'm not important enough to them to include on a regular basis anymore. What did I do wrong? Why don't I warrant their interaction, companionship and camaraderie? Thankfully, I have a wonderful best friend that lives in the same city as I do now, and my family (my parents in particular) are the people I'm closest to in the world, so I know that I can pick up the phone, day or night, and talk to the people who love me more than anything else in the world.

I don't have any friendships that have lasted years and years, because inevitably, the people I considered my closest friends have treated me in ways that had severe negative impacts on my mental health and fractured our relationships beyond repair, so I've had to sever ties with them. I only made one friend the entire time I was in college, because I transferred to so many different schools, that by the time I was somewhere for longer than a semester, everyone had already established friend groups that I just couldn't penetrate and belong to. So I begged the universe for \"just one friend\".

I never know when my mind is going to sabotage me and am never prepared so the feeling is always the same; miserable and agonising. I think I’m only starting to starting to realise it’s not solely a feeling, it’s a living. It’s a part of my life and myself and it's a part of human nature. I know I'm not alone in my feelings but still, I feel lonely.<br /><br />P.S. I'm only sad so when I say I don't want to experience the rest of my life I don't meant that in a literal sense. I am in fact looking forward to growing up and hopefully growing away from this loneliness.<br /><br />P.P.S. Thank you for what you are doing, sharing my thoughts makes me feel less lonely and the possibility of someone reading them and understanding what I'm saying makes everything a lot better.",

Now I find empty spaces and surprises to fill them. Roy had once taken me to his University campus in Alberta, Canada, I had attended several of his High school reunions, listened to many stories from his adolescent years, met old friends and buddies from his Military years and yet here are new facts and new faces to complete the picture.<br /><br />I found two High school diplomas: one issued in Roy’s hometown, from Fergus County High School in the year 1954 and another one dated in1955 from Canada. Perhaps the diploma issued in Canada was a requirement for admission to the University of Alberta? I also learned that Roy served in the National Guard in Montana and yet he was drafted into the Army. I find it interesting that the VW beetle he purchased from the factory in Germany cost him 5,500 DM, which at that time was equal to 1,375 U$...and while I turn these documentations around in my hands, I felt a growing need to share my emotions with Roy. I wanted to dive into memories with him and also relive the ones we did share, sit in that seafoam green Volkswagen and explore Europe and the US together one more time, the beginning of our relationship becoming fresh and new again.<br /><br />As many memories flooded my mind and the realization that we never again would share these memories became reality, I was surprised that my sadness focused on him, on Roy.

It is up to me to nurture and keep them alive. <br /><br />There he is, sitting across the table from me. The expression on his face tells me that he has noticed the tears rolling across my cheeks. He looks puzzled and uncomfortable. In these long years of the advancement of dementia, his life disappeared with the slow loss of memory – he lost his wife, his children, and finally himself. How can anyone cope with such tragedy? The process of experiencing fear, denial, anger and shame must finally give in to total darkness. He and I shared these stages differently, but together.

Friends are casually supportive, but mostly I am isolated and exhausted by the effort of just keeping her afloat.

My parents were often gone to work before I woke up and didn’t return home before I was already in bed for the night. My brother was old enough to help out with the family business so he was often gone with my parents but there was no place for me at the family business so I was by myself in this strange house for the entire summer. Too young to drive, too far out to walk or ride my bike to visit any friends so I was just stuck there. In the middle of nowhere with nothing to do, no computers or internet or social media back then, we didn’t have any family pets and the lone black and white TV only got three channels. The radio was my only company during those lonely months and I would spend my days singing along and dancing around the house to the songs on the radio. Although I loved the songs at the time (“The Friends of Mr. Cairo” by Jon Anderson of YES and “Gemini Dreams” by The Moody Blues, for example) when I hear those songs now they bring me right back to that lonely summer as a kid and make me incredibly sad.

At least this gave me an income. The State pension wouldn‘t be available for another 6 years. I thought I could manage with savings. What I hadn‘t considered was how isolated I would become. Everyone important to me were a lot wealthier than I am, enjoying social lives I could no longer afford. I spiralled into a deep depression and didn‘t know how to ask for help. I had spent my life putting others first. Even in depression, I put on an act so not to place my burden onto others. I started to withdraw from social contact, it was easier to stay at home where I could be ‘safe'. Also, a lot of the people around me were of the 'get a grip ' response to mental illness. I felt inadequate enough, I didn't need friends telling me to get a grip. Gradually, I've built up a life with volunteering, looking after my grandchildren, joining groups which cost very little, but, I still feel lonely for that one person who would provide companionship in old age. I feel very vulnerable for the first time in my life!\f",

I have a daughter who did what she could, but she's a nurse and did very long hours at the hospital. ",

It was a really nice party, actually, with fairy lights and nice people from other schools and a lot of dark beer. And vodka — which I had a preference for. One of my friends felt depressed and I didn‘t want to leave her alone, but I also wanted to keep drinking, so I grabbed a bottle of rose vodka. I guess I felt like that night was supposed to be a rite of passage or something. We walked to this peach tree orchard at the center of our town, only a few blocks away, but by then I was drunk out of my mind. I couldn‘t even walk, I kept stumbling into fire hydrants. The last thing I remember from that night was shrieking, “I love you!” to her half-sickened-half-concerned face. <br /><br />I woke up the next morning at like 3 am and it was horrible, the worst I‘ve ever felt in my whole life. All my friends and a few strangers were sleeping in the next room over and I was in some guy‘s shirt because my friend didn‘t have any clothes that fit me. And it was my birthday. I stumbled over to her couch and sat on it and the world was just so quiet. Suddenly, I was 15 years old and hungover and everything hurt because I was scraped-up. There were thorns in my feet because I‘d walked barefoot places. I‘ve never felt so alone in my life. I wanted to be held so badly. For someone to tell me that it was okay, to stop crying, even wish me a happy birthday. I felt so small and afraid. I put my hands between my thighs and just kept looking at my toes and how chipped up my coral nail polish was even though I‘d got them done with my mom the day before. I remember all of this viscerally. The morning stars, the silent TV, and me. <br /><br />Nobody comforted me when they woke up finally, obviously, besides a few comments about how scared people got when my pulse began to stutter. I don‘t think they knew it was my birthday either, so I got no birthday wishes. But that didn't hurt so much. What hurt was when my mom picked me up. My mom‘s very principled about these things. I think she could tell what happened the moment I got into the car because I reeked of vodka. She didn‘t speak to me at all for the entire day. She‘s usually the one who buys cake and stuff, who gets really happy about birthdays. She canceled the big dinner we were supposed to have that night with all our family friends without telling me. That was the first time we didn‘t really celebrate. My dad didn't say anything to me either. It was like I was blanked out for that whole day. No one could even look at me. That was the loneliest I've ever felt — when I everyone I loved made me feel like I didn‘t exist, made me feel like I was repulsive and not worth anything. It was my fault and I probably deserved it, but it still made me feel so awful and alone. That no one would forgive me or at least held me with such unconditional positive regard that they could look past this mistake for one day, that day, my birthday — it hurt so much. Anyways, I still can‘t eat anything that tastes of rosewater.",

They got married pretty young — it was a love marriage, not arranged — and moved here shortly after, so they were wrapped up in their own lives even though I existed. They couldn't pick me up after school, so I got shoved into a day-care every day. Pick up time was always at 6 o’clock. They were always late. It was okay, usually. They’d give me extra snickerdoodles. One day, we went up to wait in the front office. The person I was with was getting antsy, because it was nearing seven. I think he had a date. Anyways, he gave me a slice of cake, because it had been their boss’s birthday, and let me play one of those old card games with red kings and queens and jokers on the spare computer. I don't really know how to explain it. I wasn't lonely because anything big had happened. Honestly, it felt like any other weekday. I think it's because I finally realized that I was unwanted. I felt unloved, even though rationally, I knew I wasn't. Still, that’s stayed with me and all those nights of being alone has made me carry some resentment towards my parents, even though it’s really not their fault.",

He said “hello” and I said “good game, shall we play again?” We continued to challenge each other for a while before I asked him where he was from, “Washington, D.C.” he said. He asked me, “Australia” I replied. He became intrigued as he hadn’t spoken to an Australian before. We spoke every day thereafter, exchanging numbers and Instagram handles. Before I knew it, I was head-over-heels for a man who lived over 11,000 miles away.<br /><br />I arrived in Washington, D.C. on the 31st of October 2016, 15 months after the first hello. I had just spent a month touring America, having met amazing people along the way and feeling accepted. The tour continued to New York however I departed and checked myself in at an AirBnB in Potomac, Maryland, recommended by the man of whom I had fallen for. No set plans had been made however he advised me that his mother was in hospital, he was stressed, it wasn’t good timing. I’d send a text message asking if he wanted to do this, wanted to do that though he never replied. I spent a lot of time in bed. I watched YouTube, which created an illusion of company. I dragged myself to Macy’s in the afternoon and browsed the department store alone, occasionally asking customer representatives where to locate an item, just to prove I wasn’t invisible, to feel alive for a moment. I took myself to the cinema and ate popcorn alone. I dined out alone. I drunk at a hotel bar alone.<br /><br />Occasionally we’d speak on the phone and I begged him to meet me, excuses were given. Sometimes I was given false hope, so I’d make an appointment at a beauty counter and have my make-up professionally applied, only to fall asleep at an ungodly hour having wasted my evening waiting to hear from him. I felt so utterly alone. I realised how alone I was when I continued to make appointments to have my make-up professionally applied, the beauty technician was polite and we’d share a conversation, general chit chat. Sometimes this was the only interaction I experienced all day. I felt worthless. I felt as if I was not worth his time nor effort.<br /><br />It was now the 18th of November 2016 and I spent the majority of my last day in a park watching squirrels and their behaviour. After a few final purchases and sights that had to be seen, the time had come to take myself to the airport. It was two hours before boarding and he had promised he would call so we could chat before I departed. One hour passed and I patiently waited, my anxiety level rose. I checked the time, thirty minutes until boarding and still nothing. I hid myself in a corner, called him and left a teary voice message. It was time to board and with wet eyes I showed my passport and ticket. As I was sitting down in my seat on the aeroplane, he rung. I sobbed, an air hostess asked if I was okay and I mouthed to her “saying goodbye”. She nodded and gave me a hot towel for my face, her kind gesture only caused me to sob more. The phone connection disintegrated and I was asked to switch off my mobile. <br /><br />Sometimes I question my decisions, the actions directed by a heart worn on the sleeve.The choices made by an individual can brutally effect others, I don’t think I’ve ever felt more alone in my life. In October, it will be two years since I was stood up and to this day I still cry over how I was treated, the lack of respect, the lack of answers, the silence.",

Honestly, I felt a deep sadness inside me, I had a feeling that I would forever be alone and never find myself. Instead of showing my true self, I decided to pick a random kid in our class and go on with life and girls thinking I liked this boy. I felt out of place, not accepted for myself. In around 7th grade, I found the terms asexual and aromantic.

My husband would be off at work all day, and I was stuck in a 1 bedroom apartment by myself all day until he came home.

I remember walking and playing with my dog for hours, just the two of us. And even though I had her company, I felt so lonely. Now I’m not even sure why, I guess as a child you want to be part of the group and you want to be included, and I wasn’t - on purpose - for whatever reason. Now ever since then, I feel most lonely without a dog because my best and healthiest relationships have always been with a canine. And I know my dog would invite me to a party.",

I wasn’t ready to give up my coping mechanism or dig into my trauma at that time, so I basically just got better at hiding my eating disorder, which continued to control and haunt my daily life for many years to come.<br /><br />At age 27, I was finally fed up of having my life controlled by food and exercise, and I started attending an intensive holistic therapy program at a well-respected center in Toronto. I saw a team of specialists 2-3 times a week over a period of 4 months, and eventually tapered my treatment to single weekly therapy sessions. I worked hard as hell to dig into the key causes of my eating disorder, including sexual trauma and an emotionally abusive upbringing, both which resulted in anxiety, substance abuse, and compulsive behaviour problems.<br /><br />I am privileged and fortunate to have had access to the program that eventually allowed me to heal from my eating disorder, but it came with a huge price. That summer, as a student, I used a student line of credit and OSAP to pay for the $14,000 of treatment I received. None of it was covered by the government or my limited student healthcare benefits.<br /><br />Despite an ongoing rocky and tumultuous relationship with my parents, I reached out to them for help paying for my treatment, but they said no. Since eating disorders are still so stigmatized, and because I’ve always prided myself on being independent, I was ashamed to reach out to anyone else for help. I still struggle to this day to make ends meet, but I’ve managed to get by, and now that I only have one more year of school left, there is light at the end of the tunnel. I know deep down that I’ll be okay and somehow find a way to make it through. I am resourceful as hell, and I’ll figure it out. But it really hurts that the people who should’ve been there for me more than anyone else in the world simply weren’t. <br /><br />Thankfully, due to my therapy work, I now know that my parents’ lack of support isn’t a reflection of my worth, and is instead a result of their own personal trauma and hurt. I’ve built myself up in the ways that my parents never did, and put loving people around me who make me feel supported and seen and valued. Working through my eating issues gave me the foundation to be able to finally face my sexual trauma, which has allowed me to be able to reconnect fully with my body and learn to love and care for it.<br /><br />I still get sad when I think about my relationship with my parents. I have effectively cut them off for the past 2 years, but for now I know it’s better than the alternative.

We live about 600 miles away and I was prepared to try and make it work, until we could find a way to be together. He was not ready. He told me the only way for a relationship to work is to have physical connections, which I disagree with. He went on to randomly text me every 3 or so months which was torture. I felt like every time the hurt started to go away, he came back into my life. We would talk for a week or so and he would be gone again. I felt sad and alone then, but it wasn’t until this past summer September that I started to feel lonely. This boy went on to date a new girl, and watching it was painful, I attempted to delete him from my life, and friend zone him those weeks he tried to rekindle us for whatever reason, but he always comes back.

I don’t know when or if I’ll ever shake that boy out of my head but for the time being I’m attempting to distract myself with work. If you’ve gotten to this point, thank you for reading. I am writing this for myself because writing out my thoughts really helps me progress. I also believe there is somebody else out there with similar struggles and if you are that person just know you’re not alone. I don’t know if I am going up or downhill at this point but I will continue to persevere and hopefully you reading this will too.",

This goes in both the direction of negativity and positivity, you know. It isn‘t just about fake friends. I mean, of course I‘m skeptical of my acquaintances as well as my opponents; I detest the chore of determining whether someone truly enjoys my company or just appreciates how their congeniality towards me makes their reputation look just as much as I abhor figuring out whether someone really dislikes me or if they‘re just afraid to be associated with someone so physically repulsive. <br />The first time I was mocked for the way I looked was my first day of pre-school, when a girl in my class, Cassidy, made a comment comparing me to the mouse from Cinderella. She told me I wasn't fat, just chubby. This situation directly correlates to conventional standards and what were taught from PRESCHOOL about what looks \"good\" and what doesn't. She told the other children how she felt about me, and they developed a game in which they ran from me and called me an \"ugly monster\". I wasn't in on the game, it was just a method of excluding me from participating in the actual games people would play behind my back. It was cruel. I still experience torment like this in my day-to-day high-school life. <br />The number of people who call themselves ugly without being provoked to do so is incalculable and exasperating to imagine. Being less prepossessing than your peers is far more elaborate than a simple flaw – it's being susceptible to unequal treatment, akin to what I've received since the day I started school. It's the everlasting fear of ridicule and hearing brutal derision from others that you've become so familiar with–- because you do adjust, eventually – ring in the back of your head, like a bell. It's having to understand and fully accept the fact that, to the majority, you'll never be more than your external appearance, despite your persistent effort to be judged rightfully. I still, to this day, feel completely alone and isolated, because I know for a fact that no one in my life could ever possibly even come close to understanding the way I feel.",

My family told me things like “don’t get too friendly: at Christmas people will expect Christmas presents.” I think that the goal was to isolate me and my sisters so the abusive behaviors could be hidden. Consequently, I didn’t have the best social skills. <br /><br />I got older and got tired of being secretive and miserable. To my surprise, when I got a little more open, some people (not all) turned out to be sympathetic. I hadn’t known that I came off as cold: I was trying to be professional. <br /><br />But I still felt lonely sometimes. I got married to a musician who seemed to be a good match. It was as if our motto was “you and me against the world.” <br /><br />Part of that “you and me against the world” turned out to be a kind of grooming by my husband. There was this great enveloping narrative that he was this great musician, he had never gotten what he deserved career-wise, his ex-wife was a conniving &*&, and with my help he was going to “make it.” <br />That should have been my clue right there. We got along—as long as I kept in mind that my life’s work is supposed to be “figuring out how to make HIM successful”. One day I woke up and realized that I could not fix this person. Starting in the morning, along with a cup of coffee, I get a full dose of his negativity—this person won’t “give him a job,” and that person won’t acknowledge what a great musician he is. And that I am selfish for not dropping my exhausting work schedule to stop and work on music with him. (Because that makes sense—stop my paid work to work on music that hasn’t paid much in the many many years we have been together.) <br /><br />Amy Tan (the author) recently spoke on Fresh Air (a radio program) about her mother (who she describes as possibly borderline). She pointed out her mother was only happy when they were both complaining about the ills of the world (real or imagined). Similarly, I am only on my husband’s good side when I agree with him about all the wrongs he feels he faces. He rarely sees positives; he lives in a world of perpetual grievance. <br /><br />I work from home now. He is home all the time. He spends all day trying to get me to agree with his narrative of the world. It’s exhausting, it’s stifling, and I feel I can never have my own head space. And it’s lonely.",

We traveled the country, and later the world, and though I was surrounded by people all the time (band mates, other bands, people‘s houses we stayed at, fans / audience) I felt completely alone. <br /><br />The other members of the band were very politically minded, socially conscious folks who thought very highly of themselves in terms of awareness, acceptance, and compassion not to mention thinking themselves champions of the underdog and the oppressed. Despite all of their rhetoric when it came down to it they simply could not, or would not, accept me and the communication / attention / emotional issues that being on the spectrum present.

It’s very hard for me to get close to people and this experience made that much harder still.

I worry that I‘ll never feel any of those things again, even though feeling them the first time almost ruined me. <br /><br />After that experience I fell into a deep depression that eventually led to me becoming a heroin addict for the next six years on and off, until the final two years were just on and I almost died.

I had a vivid imagination, one that went wild into fantasy or my potential future life. But that didn’t extend past dreaming and writing stories. I was too afraid of being embarrassed by the other children, being made fun of or singled out for something I did.

		"mostLonely": "A few years ago, I went up to my cottage with my sister and a couple of her friends. On Sunday they left to head home ahead of my sister and I, so we went for a quick fishing trip in the morning, with plans to drive home that afternoon. On the trip, she started asking me probing questions about my my mental and physical health. We weren’t really on that level of sharing, and I was in counselling already to help define boundaries between me and my family as their impact on me was continuously negative. This incident proved, again, to be exactly that. I tried to answer her questions with a certain restriction, as I wasn’t game to share too much - she previously hadn’t treated my experience and feelings with a level of respect that I appreciated. This seemed to antagonize her, and she pressed really hard for info. Then asking why we can’t get along. Why are we not better sisters? I had to let her know I didn’t trust her with my stuff. That I’ve been through a trauma in my childhood, that she doesn’t accept or understand, and I still deal with PTSD-like symptoms to this day that she doesn’t acknowledge. She asked if I had been diagnosed, and pressed to see if my counselling was appropriate to deal with my issues. I felt very judged and triggered by her questions, she again didn’t show the concern for me that I felt a sister should show. It was clinical and cold. It seemed to come from the doubt she had about my experience.  So I called her out on that, and got angry, eventually lashing out. <br /><br />My reaction was exaggerated and extreme. It came from a deeply hurt place in me, that perpetually feels the divide between me and my family and longs for more care and consideration from them. She lashed back, and it just didn’t de-escalate. Over 4 hours we fought as we packed up the cottage. Eventually I paid $40 for a cab to take me to the bus station in town. Then $70 for a bus ticket home, leaving her at the cottage to drive home solo. I fended off my dad in a follow-up call, where he accused me of being the problem, again. <br /><br />I sat on a pre-made floating dock from a store near the bus stop, crying as I defended myself, and all the information I shared with my sister.  I answered the phone thinking he might be concerned for me. Maybe he was, but it’s not what came through. This was the most decisive move I’ve made against my family, in support of myself. It’s also the first time I very physically felt the divide. It is a deep wound, to be emotionally estranged from your family out of self-preservation. Like every time I am feeling alone and need support, and think maybe I’ll call home. I have to point to the wound and remind myself of the hurt. Cause if I don’t they’ll do it again, and I’m the one who suffers. So alone is an everyday feeling. I felt it the most that day, but the wound is always with me.",

About 5 years ago I stopped drinking and had my first of 3 children. As the bar days were over and I was spending more time at home with my family. Things seemed good and stable. <br /><br />It was around this time that the dynamics in my household started to change. I love my partner to death but as we started to argue more often I realized that she was my only confidant.

With kids screaming and enough problems of her own, these conversation were becoming further and further apart. I had so much to share, but no one to share with. Scrolling through my phone looking for someone to reach out to, I found no shortage of business associates, old college buddies, some far of relatives but no one that I could share my most inner feelings with. This was when I felt the hurt in my chest knowing that this time I really was alone. I had a bomb of emotions inside me and I needed to diffuse it. I went for a walk, allowed myself to hurt and began to reassure myself that albeit I felt alone in that moment, that out there was another man walking on a path, feeling my same emotions.<br /><br />Loneliness definitely hurts. I have tried to take my experiences and use them to learn about myself and experience how the human soul can persevere.

I’ve come to realize now that I actually hate gaming because I was using it as a coping method to block out some aspects of my life which I was wanting to just shove away. I was also using sleep as a coping method sometimes even when I wasn’t tired at all. <br /><br />What I was wanting to hide and why I wasn’t so involved socially with others is the fact that I am gay. I had known since I was just twelve years old but up until about high school it hadn’t been a bother. It was not only boring being by myself but I felt like empty space and had no real feelings. Some people told me to try different things, you know, like meet new people as if its as easy as the snap of a finger. They didn’t know I was gay. What they didn’t know about me, what my closest friends or family didn’t know about me is that I got really anxious around others, my heart rate increases, and if I am not comfortable around people my words come out funny. <br /><br />I usually played it off cool but as my schooling continued It became more obvious. I got lonely because of my sexuality but also because of how the few friends that I did have left me feeling. I did not tell them that I was gay nor did any of my mannerisms, the way I dress, talk, or hold myself give it away. If a guy they simply stopped being my friend. I don’t know if it was because I wasn’t as close as a guy friend should be or just because I was already so lonely. If a girl they usually thought I was wanting to date them even though I just wanted to be friends and after a while we just wouldn’t click anymore. I felt bad because I thought I was the one making them not be my friends, I thought that I was different than the normal teens at the school.

Again, I’m reminded I’m alone and the feeling of loneliness (and then sadness) sets in. <br /><br />I’ve been divorced for 8 years. I was married to a man who is a local in this town. He has a reputation that is not always favourable by some, which leaves the locals avoiding me when it comes to relationships and/or dating. He has been controlling in our marriage, and since I walked out it’s been worse. Since my divorce, I have had experiences where men express their like for me, but because of who my ex can be, they prefer not to have to “deal” with him. I feel that I have been branded in his town, which further makes me feel alone and lonely. I have shared custody and therefore my options of relocating is not great. Most days I’m ok with being single. But it’s because of the examples I listed above, the feeling of being lonely is amplified and acutely at the forefront. <br /><br />Social media is damaging for us all as well. Loneliness has left me feeling depressed and ironically isolating myself. Being around people do not always make me feel less lonely. I’m some situations I felt more alone. <br /><br />I am recently practicing yoga. I am doing my best to be mindful and present. Limiting my time on social media. I am practicing being grateful for the great things in my life and keeping myself busy with friends and family. But even with that, the loneliness haunts me and it’s a fight. ",

Myself, along with many of my girlfriends are divorced with joint custody of their children.  All of my friends have met and started new lives with someone else, all except me. I was in a room full of people and I was not only alone, but felt lonely. I couldn’t understand how that could be when I was surrounded by many people and have so many people love me.

At first I didn‘t think much about being \"lonely\" – I had just moved to a foreign place and I didn‘t know anyone yet, after all. I was like, give it more time, you‘ll make some friends and it will be great. But even though I have made some friends here it has been more out of proximity than actual connection. The students here do not share the same values as I do and they look upon my hobbies and lifestyle with derision. I realized that I couldn‘t actually open up to anyone about what was on my mind – and in the rare moments that I did, I was met with polite disinterest, confusion, or even at times veiled disdain. So I stopped telling people about myself. I stopped caring to make human connection. I felt that the people I was surrounded with were completely unrelatable and I started to wonder if it was really me, and not them - everyone else seemed to be making friends. I have \"friends.\" I just don't like them that much, and I don't think they like me that much either. <br /><br />On top of feeling alienated from my peers, medical school is, obviously, a tough program to get through. I am stressed and irritable all the time. Any mental health issues that I seemingly had under control before I got here came rushing back into my life like a freight train. I have one good source of support, my significant other, but I can feel his palpable frustration when I complain about the same things over and over again. I can feel my negativity weighing him down when I tell him about how I want to give up on this \"dream\" and come home. I can almost hear his sigh when I text him telling him I can't do this anymore. It is difficult for him, being removed from this situation, to understand what I am going through, to understand how tough it is. <br /><br />So I'm lonely because I don't feel close to the people around me who would actually get what I'm dealing with, and I'm lonely because the person who I do feel connected to doesn't understand. I think about suicide a lot. I'm almost done with this program. I just remind myself that this is almost over. I'm counting the days.",

		"mostLonely": "As I walked back along the darkening streets tonight, an evening in early May, the birds were still singing and the smell of spring was fresh and floral in the air around me. It reminded me, viscerally, suddenly, of the hill behind my childhood home that Dad and I used to climb after dinner. We’d bring a banana or chocolate mousse and eat them sitting on the bench at the top, looking out at the panoramic views of the city’s old stone and slate roofs. <br /><br />Sometimes, memories like these fill you with warmth, a welcome gift proffered at an unexpected moment. Sometimes, they just serve to remind you of all the things that are different now. In this case, I immediately feel nostalgic for my Dad and my secret language, confined to those pre-adolescent years; for those familiar horizons, the sense of belonging they provoke; for the irrelevance of the future then, a blurry, intangible time in a child’s mind. <br /> <br />Since moving here, I’ve been lonely most of the time. Even when I’m with newly-made friends, even when I’m laughing, even when I’m absorbed in a talk or a class or a reading, there are always people and places I miss. <br /><br />I’d already got used to the absence of my city’s old stones, slate roofs, many hills. I’d got used to being an ocean away from my family, my friends, my first boyfriend. But it was different then. Now, I’ve moved away not just from my first home, but also my second, the one I’ve constructed over almost seven years and that I’m still actively shaping every time I return. <br /><br />When I first moved here, I was frustrated by the knowledge that in every coffee shop and lecture hall, there were bound to be like-minded people, potential new friends. This is a university town, after all. There are all sorts of interesting people here and I knew, tantalisingly, that I was probably walking past them in the narrow historic streets every single day. <br /><br />It was different in the place that has become my second home. There, the loneliness of the first six months were combatted by making friends and basking in the knowledge that we’d have another four years together in the same place, embarking upon and later completing our first university degrees. Here, there’s barely enough time to finish the reading lists, let alone spend hours over a beer getting to know someone. Given the nature of academic rigour in this place, the former activity often takes precedence. <br /><br />Now that I’m almost done, the course finishing in a flash of visiting scholar talks, library fines and wine receptions, I am telling myself that those potential friends don’t matter anymore. I am telling myself that I will walk over the cobbles and down the lanes content with my own company, happy in the knowledge that my community is elsewhere and it’s not going anywhere: it’s me that left, it’s me that will return. I am telling myself, as my partner so often tells me from across the ocean (in the other direction, this time), to be happy with what I am doing rather than what I could be doing. Some days it works, and I feel strength in solitude, rather than weakness in isolation. <br /><br />But some days, when the smell of spring is especially strong, or the sound of silence becomes too loud, it makes me wish for another time, another place. And on those days, I ride it out, I try to write a little, I (often unsuccessfully) avoid reaching for my phone to replicate absent people’s presences with messages (because it’s never the same), and I remind myself that I chose this. I chose to move away and move away and move away again. And equally, I will choose to move back. <br /><br />In this way, loneliness is a temporary state, and, ultimately, a necessary one. For without loneliness, how could we ever truly appreciate company? Without loneliness, would those memories return to us so visceral, full-bodied, nostalgia-inducing? I don’t think so. It is loneliness, then, that allows us, that gives us the time and space and necessary aloneness, to reflect on all that was and all that is still to come.",

I could smell food being made inside homes, and I could hear kids playing in the backyard.

I never lived in big Canadian houses growing up. They look like the movies.<br /><br />I never walked my golden retriever in a park. I never ran unsupervised with my friends, freely, around the neighbourhood.<br /><br />Instead of bemoaning how badly I miss Brazil - the music, the warmth, the colours and trees, and most importantly, my language - I am here now. I am trying to let go of my old life (kicking and screaming) and build a Canadian life. It feels like the loneliest thing in the world to do. I don’t know anybody else who is doing it.

She asked how I was and I admitted to my bewilderment with the health and behavioral problems with my little girl. She looked at me smugly, knowingly, and suggested that if I would stay at home and give my daughter the time and attention she clearly needed, perhaps this wouldn't be a problem for me any longer.

I thought of all of my friends who disappear when they start dating someone new and sometimes never return; I wonder how many people on the boardwalk have traded in nights with best friends for nights with significant others.
